          find in JavaScript?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4" id="answer1">The map() method returns a new array, the forEach() method returns
          undefined. Filter() returns an array containing the element that satisfies the condition, but find() returns
          the element that satisfies the condition. <br>
          In summary, map() and filter() create new arrays, forEach() iterates through the original array and executes a
          provided function, and find() returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies a provided
          testing function.</p>

          storage and Cookies?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4" id="answer2">
          They all are the ways to store data on the client-side in web browsers, but they vary in terms of their
          storage capacity, usage etc.<br>
          <span class="text-red-400">1</span>. <span class="text-red-400">LocalStorage</span>: LocalStorage is a
          persistent client-side storage mechanism
          that allows you to store key-value
          pairs in a web browser.<br>
          <span class="text-red-400">2</span>. <span class="text-red-400">SessionStorage</span>: Session storage is a
          great way to improve the performance
          of your web applications. It is
          similar to LocalStorage in that it allows you to store key-value pairs in a web browser, but it is used to
          store data that needs to be available only during a single browser session. The data is cleared when the user
          closes the browser or tab. <br>
          <span class="text-red-400">3</span>. <span class="text-red-400">Cookies</span>: Cookies are small text files
          that are stored on the client-side
          by the web browser. Cookies are
          used to store small amounts of data that can be sent back to the server with subsequent requests.

        <h2 class="text-lg text-red-400 font-semibold mb-4">What is Event loop in JavaScript? How it works?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4" id="answer1">
          The event loop is responsible for taking tasks from a queue and processing them one at a time. It constantly
          checks the queue for tasks and executes them in a continuous loop, ensuring that the browser or runtime
          environment stays responsive to user interactions.
