          find in JavaScript?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4" id="answer1">The map() method returns a new array, the forEach() method returns
          undefined. Filter() returns an array containing the element that satisfies the condition, but find() returns
          the element that satisfies the condition. <br>
          In summary, map() and filter() create new arrays, forEach() iterates through the original array and executes a
          provided function, and find() returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies a provided
          testing function.</p>

          storage and Cookies?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4" id="answer2">
          They all are the ways to store data on the client-side in web browsers, but they vary in terms of their
          storage capacity, usage etc.<br>
          <span class="text-red-400">1</span>. <span class="text-red-400">LocalStorage</span>: LocalStorage is a
          persistent client-side storage mechanism
          that allows you to store key-value
          pairs in a web browser.<br>
          <span class="text-red-400">2</span>. <span class="text-red-400">SessionStorage</span>: Session storage is a
          great way to improve the performance
          of your web applications. It is
          similar to LocalStorage in that it allows you to store key-value pairs in a web browser, but it is used to
          store data that needs to be available only during a single browser session. The data is cleared when the user
          closes the browser or tab. <br>
          <span class="text-red-400">3</span>. <span class="text-red-400">Cookies</span>: Cookies are small text files
          that are stored on the client-side
          by the web browser. Cookies are
          used to store small amounts of data that can be sent back to the server with subsequent requests.

        <h2 class="text-lg text-red-400 font-semibold mb-4">3. What is Event loop in JavaScript? How it works?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4" id="answer1">
          The event loop is responsible for taking tasks from a queue and processing them one at a time. It constantly
          checks the queue for tasks and executes them in a continuous loop, ensuring that the browser or runtime
          environment stays responsive to user interactions.

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4" id="answer3">The <span class="text-blue-600">`quiztimer`</span> function handles a
          timer. The function takes a parameter <span class="text-blue-600">`dismiss`</span> which determines whether to
          clear the timer or not. If <span class="text-blue-600">`dismiss`</span>
          is truthy (null, undefined, or NaN), the <span class="text-blue-600">`clearInterval`</span>
          method is called on the global
          timer variable, which stops the timer. If <span class="text-blue-600">`dismiss`</span> is falsy, the function
          starts the timer by calling the
          <span class="text-blue-600">`setInterval`</span> method on the global timer variable. The <span
            class="text-blue-600">`setInterval`</span> method sets a callback function that will
          be
          executed every 1000 milliseconds.

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4" id="answer4">The <span class="text-blue-600">`chooseQuiz`</span> function takes an
          index and a given answer as
          parameters. It checks if an element with the same ID as the quiz data at the given index exists in the
          <span class="text-blue-600">`answers`</span>
          array. If it exists, it updates the given answer for that quiz. Otherwise, it adds a new quiz with the given
          answer to the <span class="text-blue-600">`answers`</span> array. Finally, it calls a <span
            class="text-blue-600">`displayAnswers`</span> function with the updated <span
            class="text-blue-600">`answers`</span> array
          as an
          argument.
